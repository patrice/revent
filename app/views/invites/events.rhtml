<em>The more invitations our leaders get, the greater the chances are that they'll rise to the occasion on November 3rd--so let's get cracking. Something to keep in mind: phone calls make more of an impact with politicians, so do that first, and then move on to the others.  With your help, we can make November 3rd HUGE.</em>
