Website Setup Services
The Event tool requires a basic amount of setup and customization to be useable by your
organization. We will provide the following services
 Template Installation  We will apply the html and css from your current
website into a template on the event system
 Form Customization  We will customize your event signup form to allow for
custom field data collection that can be stored in DIA. We will also set up the
event host and event attendee forms to add users to groups in DIA and initiate
DIA trigger emails.
 Resource Attachment We will upload documents that will be accessible for the
event hosts to download form within that host control panel.
 DIA Integration and Data Syncing  We will create a map between DIA
distributed events and our system. Data syncing between the systems can be done
by us in the case that of preexisting data in the DIA system.

Custom Development and Extended Intergration
 Blog Layout  We will create a list page of all host announcement across all
events that will allow you to see all updates posted by the hosts on one page.

objects to map the event information to deal with inadequcies of the Salesforce

that needs to be tracked. Time range will depended on current Salesforce setup
and object map.
